## About
This Mini-Project for SC1015 looks into the Olympic Games from the [120 Years of Olympic History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/120-years-of-olympic-history) dataset. The following is a brief preview of the project:
1. Data Exploration
>- Scoping the project, separating data by gender, relationship between variables
2. Data Cleaning and Merging
>- Filling in NULL values, merging dataset with GDP and Population
3. Medal Analysis and Visualization
>- Compare medal count of countries, relationship between medal count and GDP
4. SMOTE and Random Forest Classifier
>- Dealing with class imbalance, predict medals based on chosen factors
